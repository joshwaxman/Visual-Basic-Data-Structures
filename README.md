# Visual-Basic-Data-Structures
Data Structures for use in VB and VBA

##Description
An implementation of several data structures and algorithms for easy use by VB6 and VBA programmers. 
Just download the class files and import them into your project.

##Motivation
Many modern languages have a wealth of data structures and algorithms available. 
Programmers can then harness these data structures and algorithms, and write their code at a higher level of abstraction.
In VB and VBA, there is very little in the way of ready-made data structures. There is the Array, the Collection, and the Scripting.Dictionary.
Further, most VB programmers are not about to implement data structures from scratch. They have an immediate problem to solve
and will take the most straightforward approach to solving it. This project is a free collection of Data Structures and Algorithms
for use in VB and VBA programs.

##Design Considerations
When implementing these data structures, we have a few priorities:
1. Readability and modifiability
2. Data structures should be able to store any type (internally stored as Variant and Object)
3. Keys should be comparable (thus will be Variant)

##Available Data Structures
At the moment, the following Data Structures are provided:

1. UnionFind
2. Queue
3. Stack
4. MaxPriorityQueue
5. RandomQueue
